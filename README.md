# Webpack Boilerplate

This is an app boilerplate based on webpack.

So far just an experiment.

Goals:

* **Simple**: use as few tools at we can
* **Babel**: support ES6
* **Hot Code Reloading**: reload all the things!

## Install

Clone this repository, then run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Then visit [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)
